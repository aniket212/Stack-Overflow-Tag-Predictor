# Stack-Overflow-Tag-Predictor

1.Stack-Overflow Tag Predictor is a multilabel based classification project. Given the Question, the model will predict which are tags that are associated with a particular Question. I have used various **Feature Engineering techniques** and various variations of Models to achieve a Micro-F1 score of 0.5.

2.Performed Hyper-Parameter tuning on the various Hyper-Parameters to choose the best value of Hyper-Parameter that fits the data well.Used techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomSearch to perform Hyper-Parameter tuning
